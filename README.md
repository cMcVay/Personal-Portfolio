## Who Am I? 

I grew up in South Florida :palm_tree::sun_with_face:  
then I graduated from NYU with a BFA in Film Production :city_sunset: :mortar_board::movie_camera:  
Post grad, I worked as a producer for film and podcasts :headphones::memo::watch::clapper:  
But during the pandemic, I had an idea for a custom fantasy baseball website :baseball:  
I explored what it would take to build the site and started taking online courses :computer:  
What I discovered was that I had a real passion for coding :smiley: :bulb:
